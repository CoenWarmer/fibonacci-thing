A game with a 50x50 grid of buttons (now configurable all the way up to 5000x5000 = 25.000.000 cells) that allows a user to click on a cell and increment the value of all the cells in the same row and column by 1. 
If in this process one or more fibonacci sequences of 5 values are found, we color the sequence so the user can easily spot them. Then, after 5 seconds, we reset the found sequence back to zeroes.
