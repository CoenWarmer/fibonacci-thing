[screen.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0bbe457-4d3e-44b1-914a-8be7cb885dab)


A game with a 50x50 grid of buttons that allows a user to click on a cell and increment the value of all the cells in the same row and column by 1. If in this process one or more fibonacci sequences of 5 values are found, we color the sequence so the user can easily spot them. Then, after 5 seconds, we reset the found sequence back to zeroes.
