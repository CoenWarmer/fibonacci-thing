A small game with a 50x50 grid that allows a user to click on a cell and increment the value of all the cells in the same row and column by 1. If in this process a fibonacci sequence of 5 values if formed, we color the sequence so the user can easily spot it. Then after 5 seconds we reset the found sequence back to zeroes.
